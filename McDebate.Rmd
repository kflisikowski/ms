In the TVP program The TVP Debates 100 people were surveyed regarding their opinion about capital punishment. 30 were in favor and 70 were against. They then listened to a debate about the subject and the survey was repeated. This time 35 voted in favor and 65 against. 11 changed their mind from against to in favor and 6 changed their mind from in favor to against. Did the debate affect peopleâ€™s opinions? Assume 0,05 significance level.

```{python}
from statsmodels.stats.contingency_tables import mcnemar

# Load the data from the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('debate_opinions.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the data
print("Raw Dataset:")
print(df.head())

# Create a contingency table
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['Before_Debate'], df['After_Debate'])
print("\nContingency Table:")
print(contingency_table)
```


```{python}
# Perform McNemar's test
result = mcnemar(contingency_table, exact=True)

# Print the results
print("\nMcNemar's test result:")
print(f"Statistic: {result.statistic}")
print(f"P-value: {result.pvalue}")

# Interpretation
alpha = 0.05
if result.pvalue < alpha:
    print("The p-value is less than 0.05, indicating that the debate significantly affected people's opinions.")
else:
    print("The p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that the debate did not significantly affect people's opinions.")
