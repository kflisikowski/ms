```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
# Load the data from the CSV file
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kflisikowski/ms/main/scooter_satisfaction.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows of the data

print(df.head())
```

Assume that youâ€™re a market researcher and you want to compare experience of 2 groups of randomly selected people using two different scooter sharing service providers. Would you say that there is a significant difference in satisfaction score for two scooter car sharing service providers with alpha=0.05 level of significance?

```{python}
#test normality 
from scipy.stats import shapiro
stat, p = shapiro(df['Yamaha'])
print('Statistics=%.3f, p=%.3f' % (stat, p))
stat, p = shapiro(df['Suzuki'])
print('Statistics=%.3f, p=%.3f' % (stat, p))
```


```{python}
# check homogeneity of variance
from scipy.stats import levene
stat, p = levene(df['Yamaha'], df['Suzuki'])
print('Statistics=%.3f, p=%.3f' % (stat, p))
```



```{python}
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Perform a pooled t-test:
result = ttest_ind(df['Yamaha'], df['Suzuki'],
alternative='two-sided', equal_var=True)
print(result)
```
