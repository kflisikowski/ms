```{python}
import pandas as pd

```{python}
# Load the data from the CSV file
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kflisikowski/ms/main/scooter_satisfaction2.csv"

Assume that youâ€™re a market researcher and you want to compare experience of 2 groups of randomly selected people using two different scooter sharing service providers. Would you say that there is a significant difference in satisfaction score for two scooter car sharing service providers with alpha=0.05 level of significance?

```{python}
#test normality 
from scipy.stats import shapiro
stat, p = shapiro(df['Yamaha'])
print('Statistics=%.3f, p=%.3f' % (stat, p))
stat, p = shapiro(df['Suzuki'])
print('Statistics=%.3f, p=%.3f' % (stat, p))
```


```{python}
# check homogeneity of variance
from scipy.stats import levene
stat, p = levene(df['Yamaha'], df['Suzuki'])
print('Statistics=%.3f, p=%.3f' % (stat, p))
```



```{python}
from scipy.stats import ttest_rel
# Perform a paired t-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_rel(df['Yamaha'], df['Suzuki'])

# Print the results
print("\nPaired T-Test result:")
print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")

# Interpretation
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("The p-value is less than 0.05, indicating that there is a significant difference in satisfaction scores between Yamaha and Suzuki.")
else:
    print("The p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that there is no significant difference in satisfaction scores between Yamaha and Suzuki.")
```
