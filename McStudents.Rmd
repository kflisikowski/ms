```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```


```{python}
# Load the data from the CSV file
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kflisikowski/ms/main/quiz_results.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows of the data

```

Let's assume we have a dataset of students who took two different quizzes (Quiz 1 and Quiz 2) and we want to see if there is a significant difference in their pass/fail status between the two quizzes. We can use McNemar's test to determine if there is a significant association between the two categorical variables.

```{python}
from statsmodels.stats.contingency_tables import mcnemar

# Create a contingency table
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['Quiz1'], df['Quiz2'])
print("\nContingency Table:")
print(contingency_table)

# Perform McNemar's test
result = mcnemar(contingency_table, exact=True)

print(result)
```

Interpretation of the results:
- The p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that there is no significant difference in pass/fail status.
