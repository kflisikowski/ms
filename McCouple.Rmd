1,000 couples were surveyed regarding their opinion regarding criminal reform. Some of husbands were in favor and some against the proposition, while some of the wives voted in favor and against it. In some of the couples, the husband was in favor but the wife was against it. In some the wife was in favor but the husband was against it. Was there a significant difference between husbands and their wives about this reform? Assume 0.05 significance level.
